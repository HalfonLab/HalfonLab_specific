# HalfonLab_specific
Scripts configured specifically for use by the Halfon Lab and the CCR cluster

This repository contains various scripts developed by/for the Halfon Lab. Used as is, they should work correctly with our Project Space at CCR and for running jobs on the CCR cluster. While others are free to make use of these scripts, they will almost certainly need minor-to-major modification to be run in a different computing environment.

Halfon lab users: let Marc know if you encounter any problems with any of these scripts.
